    <h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
    <p>
        This website was made to show off my projects that I have done, whether that be a coding project, a CAD project, or something else entirely!
        The majority of the content is on the "Projects" tab, which you can find <a href="/projects">here</a>, but feel free to learn a bit about me <a href="/about-me">here</a>.
